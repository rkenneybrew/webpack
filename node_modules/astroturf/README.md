# astroturf

**astroturf** lets you write CSS in your JavaScript files without adding any runtime layer, and with your existing CSS processing pipeline.

- **Zero runtime CSS-in-JS.** Get many of the same benefits as CSS-in-JS, but without the loss of flexibility in requiring framework-specific CSS processing, and while keeping your CSS fully static with no runtime style parsing.
- Use your existing tools – **Sass, PostCSS, Less** – but still write your style definitions in your JavaScript files
- **Whole component in the single file**. Write CSS in a template literal, then use it as if it were in a separate file
